# ash

ash is an AI-operated Windows shell that allows users to interact with their operating system using natural language commands. Instead of typing traditional Windows commands, users can communicate with a ChatGPT-powered natural language assistant who will facilitate the execution of the proper commands on behalf of the user as requested.

## Usage

To use ash, simply open a terminal and start typing natural language commands. The assistant will interpret your commands and execute the appropriate Windows commands on your behalf. For example, instead of typing `ls -l` to list the contents of a directory, you can simply type "list the files in this directory" and ash will execute the `ls -l` command for you.

## Installation

To install ash, simply clone this repository and run the `install.sh` script. This will install all necessary dependencies and configure your system to use ash as the default shell.
